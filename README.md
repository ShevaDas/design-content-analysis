# design-content-analysis

This is a simple Python tool designed to provide various statistics about the length of content in various tables. This information could come in handy if you're creating a new site design and (sensibly) don't want to make assumptions about content length.

Right now it only works with Drupal-created databases, but configuring it to work with databases created by Wordpress or similar should be trivial.
